# live-temp
There are clever ventilation toolkit and web based real-time humidity, temperature, and CO2 monitoring, with human-friendly source codes.

The three main parts are:
- Arduino sketch  
- Nodejs server (serial bus capture, websocket) with html5 client  
- live-temp agent (light client for arduino/eddison capture and transfer data from addition sensors)
